## R package `AndalusiaAlgae`

This package is used to model algae toxin and algae counts simultaneously using a bivariate hidden Markov model.
It was developed focusing on western Andalusia. Algae counts (as integers) are modeled using a negative binomial model.
Toxin measurements are discretized into 4 states and then modeled with ordinal logistic regression.
